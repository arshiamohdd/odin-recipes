		<h2>A Mexican Three-milk Soaked Delicacy</h2>
		<p>Tres Leches Cake is a popular Latin American dessert known for its rich, moist texture and sweet, creamy flavor. The name "tres leches" translates to "three milks," referring to the three types of milk—evaporated milk, condensed milk, and heavy cream or whole milk—used to soak the sponge cake. This process gives the cake its signature softness and richness.</p>
		<p>Typically, the cake is made from a light and airy sponge base, allowing it to absorb the milky mixture without becoming too soggy. It is often topped with whipped cream and sometimes garnished with cinnamon, fresh fruit, or caramel for added flavor. Tres Leches Cake is widely enjoyed across Latin America and has become a favorite dessert in many parts of the world due to its indulgent taste and melt-in-the-mouth texture.</p>

		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
			<li>In a medium bowl combine flour, baking powder, and salt. Separate the eggs into two other mixing bowls.</li>
			<li>Add ¾ cup sugar to the bowl with the egg yolks and mix on high speed until yolks are pale yellow. Add ⅓ cup milk and vanilla and stir to combine. Pour the egg yolk mixture over the flour mixture and stir gently just until combined (don't over-mix).</li>
			<li>Use electric beaters to beat the egg whites on high speed. As the begin to whip into stiff peaks, gradually mix in the remaining ¼ cup of sugar. Fold the stiffly beaten egg whites into the batter gently, scraping the bottom and sides of the bowl, until combined.</li>
			<li>Pour batter into un-greased pan and smooth it into an even layer. Bake for 25 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean. Remove from the oven and allow cake to cool completely</li>

			<li>Slowly pour the milk mixture over the the top of the cake, making sure to pour near the edges and all around. Refrigerate the cake for at least 1 hour or overnight, to allow it to soak up the milk.</li>
