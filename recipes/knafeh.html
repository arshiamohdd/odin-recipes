		<h2>A Middle Eastern pistachio and Cheese Delicacy</h2>
		<p>Kunafeh (also spelled Knafeh) is a beloved Middle Eastern dessert known for its crispy, golden layers of shredded phyllo dough (kataifi) or semolina crust, filled with gooey cheese or creamy custard. The dish is soaked in a fragrant sugar syrup, often infused with rose or orange blossom water, giving it a distinctive sweetness. It is typically garnished with crushed pistachios, adding a delightful crunch that complements the rich, buttery texture.</p>
		<p>Originating from the Levant region, Kunafeh has many variations across different Middle Eastern countries. In Palestine and Jordan, it is commonly made with Nabulsi cheese, while in Egypt, a softer, cream-filled version is popular. Whether served hot and fresh from the oven or enjoyed with a scoop of ice cream, this indulgent dessert remains a staple at celebrations and gatherings, symbolizing warmth and hospitality.</p>
		<p>Knafeh is one of my favourite desserts. I grew up enjoying eating knafeh during many occasions, festivities, and celebrations.</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>1/2 pound of Kataifi (8 OZ) (half of the bag)</li>

			<li>1 pound of cheese</li>

			<li>1/2 cup unsalted butter or ghee</li>

			<li>1/4 crushed pistachios</li>

			<li>1 cup sugar syrup</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Take out the frozen kataifi dough and let it thaw for 2-3 hours before using.</li>
			<li>Preheat oven to 350F.</li>
			<li>Shred the cheese or cut it into small pieces.</li>
			<li>Shred the kataifi dough by placing it in a food processor or with a knife.</li>
			<li>Once shredded, place kataifi dough in a bowl and pour over melted butter and coloring (optional). Using your hands, massage the butter into the dough making sure everything is well integrated.</li>
			<li>Grease the bottom of the pan with some butter. Use a 9-inch pan. If using the entire kataifi bag use a 18-inch pan.</li>
			<li>Spread the majority of the dough, leaving about ¼ for the top.</li>
			<li>Add shredded cheese on top, and press well either by the palm of your hand or with the bottom of a glass.</li>
			<li>Take the remaining kataifi dough spread it over the cheese, and press well again either by hand or with the bottom of a glass.</li>
			<li>Bake for 20-30 minutes or until the edges are deeply golden and crispy and the cheese is melted, you can check the cheese with a fork.</li>
			<li>Take it out of the oven, with care flip it into another (same size or slightly larger) platter, then immediately drizzle the knafeh with about ½-3/4 of the warm sugar syrup, ensuring you cover the full surface. Reserve the remaining syrup to the side for anyone who wants extra.</li>
			<li>Sprinkle crushed pistachios on top. </li>
			<li>Cut into pieces and serve hot.</li>
